# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

## Usage

This year I'm using C# and .NET Core 3.1. to solve the challenges. To run the solutions, you'll need to have .NET Core 3.1 installed. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day you want to run and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
