# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

## Spoilers

Be aware that there are solutions are in this repository. If you don't want to see them, don't look at the code. If you do want to see them, then you're in the right place - but don't complain if you see them before you've solved the challenge yourself.

## Usage

This year I'm using C# and .NET Core 3.1. to solve the challenges. To run the solutions, you'll need to have .NET Core 3.1 installed. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day you want to run and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
